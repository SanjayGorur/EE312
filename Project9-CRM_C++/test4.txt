/*************** NOTES **************/
If you're using a classic binary search tree, then
we should initially build a tree with height 10.
Craig is the root, Billy is the left and Sue is the
immediate right child. All of the Robs (eight of them)
are descended below Sue, and they form a straight chain

If you rebalance the tree, then the height should be 4
The root of the tree should be RobD.
